# Udacity-AWS-AI-Programming-With-Python

This repository contains my final capstone project for the AI ​​& ML Scholarship announced in 2022.

The AWS Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) Scholarship program, in collaboration with Intel and Udacity, aims to help underserved and underrepresented high school and college students learn foundational ML concepts to prepare them for careers in AI and ML.

The task of the project was to create an image classifier using transfer learning, which had to be implemented in Pythorch. In addition to these, a command-line application had to be prepared, which enables training, testing, saving and loading of the model. With the help of parameters, it was possible to specify to the model whether it uses a GPU or which model architecture it uses during transfer learning.
